NAME
    macaliaser.pl - a script to create aliases for applications on OSX

SYNOPSIS
            $ macaliaser.pl -i /Applications

            $ macaliaser.pl -i /Applications /Developer

            $ macaliaser.pl -h

            $ macaliaser.pl -i /Applications > ~/.aliases

            $ macaliaser.pl -l ~/.aliases
        
            $ macaliaser.pl -l ~/.aliases | grep Mail.app

DESCRIPTION
    I have tried several of the OS X applications, which are supposed to
    speed up access to your applications and I must admin I prefer to use
    the terminal.app to everything. So this script creates aliases from all
    the application in the directories you ask it to scan.

    The recommended usage is to put the aliases in a separate file and use
    the from you preferred shell.

    I have the following line in my .bash_profile

            source "$HOME/.aliases"

    So the script can proces the file with out disturbing my other bash
    settings, apart from the .bash_profile change, I have added the
    following line to my crontab

            0 12 * * 1 $HOME/bin/macaliaser.pl -i /Applications/ \
            /Developer/Applications/ > $HOME/.aliases

    Further more I have created a single alias in my .bash_profile for

            macaliaser.pl -l ~/.aliases
        
    In the following way:

            alias aliases = 'macaliaser.pl -l ~/.aliases'

  OPTIONS
    -i (index)
        This indexes the directories listed after --

    -l (list)
        This lists the existing aliases

        Useful when you have forgotten a specific alias

FUNCTIONS
  is_app
    This checks whether a file has a name in the format:

    <name>.app

    If this is true it processes the entry further SEE suggest.

  suggest
    suggest suggest different aliases for you application, each suggestion
    is tested for existance by is_cmd, so we do not overrule any existing
    commands (like mail).

    The tries are done in the following order:

    1.  lowercase, name without .app extension

    2.  lowercase, name with .app extension

    3.  uppercased first letter with .app extension

    4.  the original name

  cmd_exist
    cmd_exists check whether there already is a command with the suggested
    alias in path.

  create_alias - not yet implemented
    create_alias is used to create the actual alias.
